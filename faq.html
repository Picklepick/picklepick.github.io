                    <p>The name has nothing to do with cucumbers preserved in brine or vinegar. Rather, it stems from the old English idiom “to be in a pickle” – meaning to be in a difficult or messy situation.</p>
                    <p>A wise traveler once said: “we are all in pickles every now and then, and it’s nice to have someone help you pick”. We took this to heart, and built an application.</p>

                    <p>A lot of us seem to always have all of the answers; In fact, we can all probably remember a time we´ve tried to seem more certain, or knowledgeable than we really are.</p>

                    <p>We believe that any truly meaningful conversation or relationship begins with a question – and that those that are brave enough to ask them will ultimately live more vivid, exciting and fruitful lives. We imagine a world where curiosity, discovery and awe are not limited to the realms of newborn babies, but one where we can all engage and include one another in our daily lives more.</p>

                    <p>Picklepick has been our attempt to make this possible in an intuitive and fun way.</p>

                    <p>We have adopted a follower-based model, which means that any pickles you publish openly on Picklepick will be accessible and answerable to those who have chosen to follow you. Non-followers may view the pickle results on your profile after expiry, but they will not be able to offer an answer or participate in the discussion unless they follow you. 

                    <p>We also offer private sending of pickles between individuals who are following each other. These pickles are strictly private, and will not be accessible or viewable to anyone else ever. </p>
