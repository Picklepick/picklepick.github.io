<ol ><li><p>PicklePick does not claim ownership of any Content that you post on or through the Service. Instead, you hereby grant to PicklePick a non-exclusive, fully paid and royalty-free, transferable, sub-licensable, worldwide license to use the Content that you post on or through the Service. </p>

</li>
<li><p>Some of the Service is supported by advertising revenue and may display advertisements and promotions, and you hereby agree that PicklePick may place such advertising and promotions on the Service or on, about, or in conjunction with your Content.

</li>
<li><p>Although it is PicklePick's intention for the Service to be available as much as possible, there will be occasions when the Service may be interrupted, including, without limitation, for scheduled maintenance or upgrades, for emergency repairs, or due to failure of telecommunications links and/or equipment. Also, PicklePick reserves the right to remove any Content from the Service for any reason, without prior notice. Content removed from the Service may continue to be stored by PicklePick, including, without limitation, in order to comply with certain legal obligations, but may not be retrievable without a valid court order.

You acknowledge and agree that your relationship with PicklePick is not a confidential, fiduciary, or other type of special relationship, and that your decision to submit any Content does not place PicklePick in a position that is any different from the position held by members of the general public, including with regard to your Content. None of your Content will be subject to any obligation of confidence on the part of PicklePick, and PicklePick will not be liable for any use or disclosure of any Content you provide.</p>

</li>
<li><p>It is PicklePick's policy not to accept or consider content, information, ideas, suggestions or other materials other than those we have specifically requested and to which certain specific terms, conditions and requirements may apply. This is to avoid any misunderstandings if your ideas are similar to those we have developed or are developing independently. Accordingly, PicklePick does not accept unsolicited materials or ideas, and takes no responsibility for any materials or ideas so transmitted. If, despite our policy, you choose to send us content, information, ideas, suggestions, or other materials, you further agree that PicklePick is free to use any such content, information, ideas, suggestions or other materials, for any purposes whatsoever, including, without limitation, developing and marketing products and services, without any liability or payment of any kind to you. </p>
