<p><b>This Privacy Policy is effective from December 1st, 2014</b>. </p>

<p>No 3<sup>rd</sup> party or other Picklepick user will have access to your personal information, and they will not be able to contact you without your approval. The following Privacy Policy determines the treatment and use of the personal information provided by you to Picklepick when you download and use the Picklepick application. By using Picklepick, you are accepting the stipulations encompassed in this Privacy Policy.</p>

<p>Treatment and Use of Data</p>

<p><b>Registering</b> – The username you enter during registration will serve as your username and will be displayed in all pickles you publish yourself, or respond to/comment on. It is also voluntary for you to enter your full name in your profile after registering. This full name will, if entered, be displayed solely on your profile, and in the application´s Search function. Entering an email, or registering with Facebook is required as verification and to be able to sign in to the app. The following data will be gathered upon login:</p>

<p>· Login with Facebook – Full name, country, email, age, gender Facebook-friend list &amp; -profile picture will be gathered automatically. User will only have to enter his/her username. </p>

<p>· Login with Email – Only the language setting on mobile unit will be gathered automatically. User will have to enter username, password, email, age and gender upon login. Full name and profile picture´s may be added voluntarily in the application. </p>

<p><b>Pickles</b> – A pickle is a time-based object made by combining a text question and one or two images for your recipients to vote on. In theory, a pickle you publish openly may be viewable and accessible to every single user on Picklepick. However, as we have adopted a follower-based model, published pickles will be most readily available to those who have actively chosen to follow your profile. Followers will receive your pickle in their personal feeds, where they may respond to- and comment on the content. The only alternate way of accessing your pickle is through discovery in the “explore feature”, due to high popularity. After expiry, the pickle will not be viewable or accessible to anybody on the application ever again. We also offer private sending of pickles between individuals who are following each other. These pickles are strictly private, and will not be accessible or viewable to anyone else ever.</p>

<p><b>Data Treatment</b> – Information on the form of usage along with data on gender, age, location are collected to give us information to how we can improve the experience, and always make content more interesting and relevant for users. Picklepick will retain the right to sell and distribute this data to 3<sup>rd</sup> parties, but guarantees that 3<sup>rd</sup> parties will never be able to associate this data with your identity, or be able to contact you. </p>

<p><b>Service Providers</b> – The app is run through servers and different operating systems. We do not control or have liability to what data they may collect on your usage of the app.</p>

<p>Communication</p>

<p><b>Push Notifications</b> – Picklepick uses push notifications to enable quicker responsiveness for those who wish to use this feature. Push notification can be deactivated on many of the common smartphones in the preferences setting on the unit.</p>

<p><b>Login</b> – Once registered, users may log in with their username and password.</p>

<p>General</p>

<p><b>Compliance</b> – We may give personal or account data in response to requests from law enforcement officials conducting investigations, subpoenas, a court order, or if we are otherwise required to lay open such information by law.</p>

<p><b>Marketing</b> – We may share non-personal data with third parties such as advertising partners. This data does not personally identify you or any other user.</p>

<p><b>Statistical Information</b> – We may gather and aggregate non-identifying information regarding your use of our Service, including, username, UID and number and type of pickles sent and received. In addition, we may also collect information about the device you’re using the App on, including what type of device it is, what operating system you’re using, device settings, unique device identifiers, and crash data.</p>

<p>Updates</p>

<p>Picklepick reserves the right to change or modify the Privacy Policy at any time without prior notice. The most current version of each Agreement can be accessed through the App settings screen. Your continued use of the App will constitute your acceptance of any revised Agreements. We recommend that you periodically check these Agreements for changes.</p>

<p>If you choose to use Picklepick, your visit and any dispute over privacy is subject to this Privacy Policy. Unless stated otherwise, our current Privacy Policy applies to all information that we have about you and your account. If you have any concern about privacy at Picklepick, please contact us at picklepick.app@gmail.com, and we will try to resolve it. </p>
